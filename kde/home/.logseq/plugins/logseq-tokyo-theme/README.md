Tokyo Themes originally started out as a conversion of the Tokyo Night theme from VSCode, and since then has converted a number of popular themes to Logseq. Each color theme has been customized to suit the style of the theme.

**NOTE:** I am currently converting this theme from the old system over to a new system that should make managing multiple color palettes easier, and not prone to causing issues. You may see bugs during this time.
